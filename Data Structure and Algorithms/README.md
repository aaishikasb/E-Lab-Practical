```
   Test Cases:
   Input
   6
   10 3 28 14 12 5
   Output
   12
```
[Solution](Q1.cpp)

### Problem Statement 2
Sorted array of n elements are given, write a program using binary search to search a given element x in A[]. Input: No of elements,elements in sorted order and the element to searched in an array. Output: The location where the element is found.
```
   Test Cases:
   Input
   5
   23 45 56 67 78
   67
   Output
   67 is present at index 4
```
[Solution](Q2.cpp)

### Problem Statement 3
An array of integers A is given, you need to find the maximum sum that can be obtained by picking some non emptysubset of the array. If there are many such non empty subsets, choose the one with the maximum number of elements in the chosen subset.
```
   Test Cases:
   Input
   5
   1 -4 -2 -3 2
   Output
   3 2
```
[Solution](Q3.cpp)

### Problem Statement 4
Abhimanyu is playing football with his friends in a ground. At every break time, he took few candies and distributes the candy to his friends, one at a time. But one of his friends always gets more candies (i.e, the same friend get is again and again). Your task is to find who gets more candies and find how many candies he got.
```
   Test Cases:
   Input
   5
   1 2 3 4 4 
   Output
   4 2
```
[Solution](Q4.cpp)

### Problem Statement 5
Given a series of N positive integers a1, a2, a3, ...., an, Find the Minimum and Maximum values that can be calculated bu summing exactly N-1 of the N integers. Then Print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two-space-separated long integers.
```
   Test Cases:
   Input
   5
   1 2 3 4 5
   Output
   10 14
```
